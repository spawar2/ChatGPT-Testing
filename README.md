This project in collaboration with P Bhave, Senior Software Engineer, Walmart. Analyze ChatGPT's codex to determine it's viability to identify basic issues with provided Python code using OpenAI's code model, current `code-cushman-001`).
[Python: os, time, datetime, openai].
Introduction:
===
Analyze ChatGPT's codex to determine it's viability to identify basic issues.
with provided Python code using OpenAI's code model, current `code-cushman-001`

Tech stack:
===
1. Python 3 preferable.

2. `openai` package, install using `pip install openai`.


Prerequisites:
===
1. Registered`OpenAI` account, to use API using `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

2. `OPENAI_API_KEY` is sourced from system's environment properties.

	a. If on Windows, refer this [__link__](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/machine-learning/oml4r/1.5.1/oread/creating-and-modifying-environment-variables-on-windows.html)

	b. If using \*NIX `env OPENAI_API_KEY = "<PROVIDE_YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY HERE>"`


Steps:
===
1. Change to `ChatGTP-Testing` folder for executing logic.

2. Run using `python chatGTP_testomg.py`

3. If all the required prerequisites are set correctly then python program will start logging the question and respective responses inside `responses` folder inside file named `response-{ISO8601 dateformat}.py`
